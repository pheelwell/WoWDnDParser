When at least ten guards gather into a troop, they form a guard troop, as the following. 
Guard Troop (10 unit squad) Medium humanoid troop (any race), any alignment Armor Class 14 (chain shirt, shield); 16 each Hit Points 55 (10d8 + 10); 11 (2d8 + 2) each Speed 30 ft.

A troop takes half damage from any effect that does not target at least half the component creatures. If the effect does not deal damage, the troop is instead immune to it. If the effect targets an area, the troop is affected normally, and takes 50% extra hit damage if the effect deals damage. A troop always counts as if it has an ally within 5 feet. ACTIONS Spear. Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft. or range 20/60 ft., one target. Hit: 22 (5d6 + 5) piercing damage; 4 (1d6 + 1) each. Spear Troop Attack.

The abomination can consume the corpse of any natural creature. Eating a creature takes a minute, allowing the abomination to expend hit dice to restore hit points. A natural creature may be cannibalized once before their corpse becomes unusable. Hook Handler. The abomination can use the spiked chain weapon in one hand without penalties. Undead Fortitude. If damage reduces the abomination to 0 hit points, it can make a Stamina saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is holy or from a critical hit. On a success, the abomination drops to 1 hit point instead. Plagued Air. The abomination emits an airborne cloud of the Undead Plague in a 5-foot radius, centered on him. Creatures that breathe the air directly must make a saving throw as if infected or risk acquiring the disease. Covering the nose and mouth and skin grants characters advantage on this check. The DC is 5 points lower than normal. ACTIONS Multiattack. The abomination makes two attacks, and can exchange any one of the two attacks with a spiked chain attack. Cleaver. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target 
Hit 12 (2d8 + 3) slashing damage. Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit 10 (2d6 + 3) bludgeoning damage, and the creature is exposed to the Undead Plague disease.

Hit 8 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 15 Strength check or else be pulled 10 feet toward to the abomination. 
Abominations are undead monstrosities created by combining many different corpses. They are slow of body and mind, but tough and strong — excellent troops for the Scourge and the Forsaken. Disease spreads about them in visible clouds, but their enchantments ensure that, while they rot, they remain horribly alive. Abominations are some of the most powerful undead creatures in Azeroth. The Forsaken use them to guard Undercity, and the Scourge employs them in a similar role. While not speedy, they are excellent at staying in one area and pounding anyone who gets close, or keeping quick creatures pinned down. 
Acolyte ―I wish only to serve.‖ Medium humanoid (human), lawful evil Armor Class 10 Hit Points 7 (2d8 - 2) Mana Points 17 (14 + 2 + 1) Speed 30 ft.

Acolytes are human beings who have given themselves over to the power of Ner‘Zhul and the Scourge. These bitter, fanatical men and women will stop at nothing to promote the Lich King‘s will and maintain the secrecy and dominance of the Cult of the Damned. They view their own deaths and the possibility of becoming undead as their ultimate rewards for their service to Ner‘Zhul. An acolyte can be cast into a Scourge sacrificial pit to become a shade, so long as it is blessed by the Lich King. A shade is born by casting the essence seal spell (heightened to level 2) on acolyte willingly sacrificing himself in the Sacrificial Pit, and then casting the Bind spell (level 2) to maintain link to conjurer. The statistics of the Scourge Shade is below. The one maintaining the connection is usually a necromancer of influence in the Scourge, as a Shade is an excellent scout, so long as they don‘t pass a hallowed area or get detected by an Alarm spell. This ritual cannot be undone or reversed by anything short of a wish spell or divine intervention (or similar abilities).

Awaken Vengeful. By touching a corpse, the avatar of vengeance can create a spirit of vengeance that joins it on its quest for righting wrongs for up to 24 hours, or until the task is complete (whichever comes sooner). This can be done at will, but an avatar of vengeance cannot have more than twenty active spirits of vengeance. Only one spirit of vengeance can be created from a single corpse, which must have died either betrayed, in battle, or any situation where the DM decides it may have lingering desire for vengeance. The statistics of the spirit of vengeance are described below. Incorporeal Movement. The avatar of vengeance can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) arcane damage if it ends its turn inside an object. Limited Telepathy. The avatar of vengeance can magically transmit simple messages and images to any creature within 120 feet of it, so long as the creature is its conjurer, quarry, or one of the allies of both parties. This ability is usually used to intimidate its quarry or remind them of an evil deed it has committed. This form of telepathy doesn‘t allow the receiving creature to telepathically respond. Unrelenting Hunter. The avatar can use a bonus action to Dash, but only to approach its quarry or travel towards it. It also has advantage on any Spirit (Perception) checks against its quarry. Vengeful Tracker. The avatar knows the distance to and direction of any creature against which it seeks revenge, even if the creature and the revenant are on different planes of existence. If the creature being tracked by the revenant dies, the revenant knows. If conjured by conjure fiend, it can track the target of its caster, but only up to 10 miles. Otherwise, she knows only its general direction. ACTIONS Multiattack. The avatar of vengeance makes two melee attacks. Moonglaive. Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 6 (1d6 + 3) piercing damage, plus 7 (2d6) shadow damage. If the target is a creature against which the avatar has designated as its quarry, the target takes an extra 14 (4d6) damage. 
Avatars of vengeance seek to slay all living creatures that harmed it in an effort somehow to bring peace to itself. It bears no feelings of guilt or remorse or pity, and its task very seriously, treating all beings with equal disregard and sparing none that get in its way. It makes full use of its incorporeal nature, moving through walls, ceilings, and floors as it attacks. No one knows exactly how Avatars of Vengeance form. Some claim that when a person with a great need for vengeance dies, their spirit becomes an avatar of vengeance. This story cannot be true, though, as avatars of vengeance are not undead creatures. Rather, they are beings composed of the raw energy of vengeance and vendetta; they are revenge given physical form from the Void, summoned up by negative emotions. Avatars of vengeance are rarely encountered naturally. They are born of a terrible wrong or bitter emotional state, and are sometimes summoned when a hurt victim receives (or sends out) a Call for vengeance. When an individual seeks vengeance with all of their will, they may inadvertently bring to life an avatar of vengeance. The spirit has a will of its own — even if the individual who created it remits their hate. The spirit does not stop until it claims vengeance upon the perpetrator of the act that caused its creation.

Spirits of Vengeance are creatures that form when an avatar of vengeance slays a humanoid. In some ways, spirits of vengeance are like lesser versions of avatars of vengeance — they are fixated on one thought: revenge. Unlike avatars, a spirit of vengeance contains bits of humanoid soul mingled with the dark energies that animate it. The avatar of vengeance that created the spirit is treated as if it charmed the spirit. Spirits of vengeance do not speak, but they do utter things that seem like words, reverberated and spoken in reverse. Spirits of vengeance possess little of the cunning of the avatar that created them. When uncontrolled, they move toward living creatures and hack them apart. Some spirits target specific creatures particularly deserving of vengeful judgment, ignoring innocents. The weapon of a spirit of vengeance is a shadowy extension of itself. Their weapons can take many forms; most resemble either the weapon of the avatar that created them or the weapons of the living creatures from which they were summoned. The above statistics block assumes a Moonglaive (shortsword).

She takes 5 (1d10) arcane damage if she ends her turn inside an object. Banshee Magic. The banshee may cast possession without a container. The soul and body of the banshee effectively occupy the targeted creature. The banshee may leave the body, materializing its own after one round of leaving. The banshee may also cast the Globe of Invulnerability spell and target any creature within 30 ft. to gain the benefits of the same  
spell. If this effect targets an enemy, they may make a Spirit saving throw to negate this effect. Innate Spellcasting. The banshee is naturally magical. The banhsee‘s spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save DC 13, +5 to spell attacks). The banshee can innately cast the following spells, requiring no material components: 3rd level (4 mana): banshee‘s curse 4th level (5 mana): drain mana 6th level (8 mana): antimagic shell (globe of invulnerability), drain mana ACTIONS Horrifying Visage. Each non-undead creature within 60 feet of the banshee that can see her must succeed on a DC 13 Spirit saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, with disadvantage if the banshee is within line of sight, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target‘s saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to the banshee‘s Horrifying Visage for the next 24 hours. Shrill Shriek. Ranged Spell Attack: +5 to hit, range 30 ft., one target. Hit: 12 (5d4) thunder damage. This requires at least 1 mana in reserve for each d4. 
Banshees were once elf women, returned to a horrible, spectral existence. Their intangible forms make them difficult to destroy, and they have numerous spell-like abilities to cripple their foes and protect their allies. Their most feared ability is that they can possess a living being, taking over its body. When the Burning Legion and the Kaldorei clashed in the War of the Ancients, 10,000 years ago, many night elf women fell. Their brutal murders returned them as banshees, and for millennia they wandered the world in lamentation, losing ever more of their dwindling sanity. Eventually, the Lich King, Ner‘zhul, learned of their existence and recruited them into the Scourge. Banshees fought in the Third War alongside other undead, and when Arthas attacked Quel‘Thalas, he found that he could make banshees of high elves as well. The 
banshee‘s shrill shrieks can be heard as far as a mile. 
Basilisk Medium monstrosity, unaligned Armor Class 15 (natural Armor) Hit Points 52 (8d8 + 16) Speed 20 ft. STR AGI STA INT SPI CHA 16 (+3) 8 (-1) 15 (+2) 2 (-4) 8 (-1) 7 (-2) Senses darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 9 Languages — Challenge 3 (700 XP) Traits Petrifying Gaze. If a creature starts its turn within 30 feet of the basilisk and the two of them can see each other, the basilisk can attempt to petrify the target, forcing the creature to make a DC 12 Stamina saving throw. This does not require an action, but does require the basilisk be able to use actions (cannot be used while incapacitated, stunned, etc. or if blinded). This can be done once per round, and may maintain this state for one minute before requiring 1d4 minutes to recover. On a failed save, the target creature is restrained as its flesh begins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn't affected. A creature restrained by this effect must make another Stamina saving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully saves three times, the effect ends, and the creature is immune to the current effect for the 1d4 minutes it takes for the Basilisk to recover. If it fails three times, the creature is turned to stone and is petrified until freed by the greater restoration spell or other magic. A creature that isn‘t surprised can avert its eyes to avoid the saving throw at the start of its turn. If it does so, it can‘t see the basilisk until the start of its next turn, when it can avert its eyes again. If it looks at the basilisk in the meantime, it must immediately make the save. If the basilisk sees its reflection within 30 feet of it in bright light, it mistakes itself for a rival and targets itself with its gaze. This otherwise acts as the Flesh to Stone spell. ACTIONS Bite. Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature.  
Hit: 10 (2d6 + 3) piercing damage plus 7 (2d6) poison damage. 
Basilisks are heavily-armored, six-legged lizards which are related to the crocolisk. Basilisk stomachs are capable of dissolving nearly anything. Because of this, basilisks have a fondness for eating crystals and rocks from the area they inhabit. This not only makes their hides extremely hard, but gives them a unique power. They're best known for their ability to petrify a person with their stare. Due to this, basilisk parts are often sought by mages and alchemists for study. These powerful, enchanted creatures are something of an anomaly throughout the land of Azeroth. 
Battle Chicken Tiny construct, unaligned Armor Class 15 Hit Points 65 (10d4 + 40) Speed 20 ft.

Ten minutes of winding the mechanism's interior provide one charge for it. ACTIONS 
Multiattack. The battle chicken can make two drill peck attacks. Drill Peck. Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (1d4 + 5) piercing damage. The target must then succeed on a DC 14 Stamina saving throw or bleed for 1 minute, losing 1 hit point per round. A bleeding creature can repeat the saving throw on each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. The target automatically ends the condition if they receive at least 1 hit point of magical healing. 
Also known as the gnomish battle chicken, this tiny construct The gnomish battle chicken is an oversized mechanical chicken. It may look silly, but it is one tough customer. Starting an inert battle chicken involves cranking cranks, pushing buttons, turning little knobs, and speaking into flared tubes. Once started the chicken obeys the voice commands of the individual who started it, attacking his enemies and doing anything else he asks. The chicken only understands simple commands. A battle chicken costs 1,280 crafting points (engineering) as a tiny construct of challenge 4 (or 32,000 gp). It has a malfunction rating of 1-5. It costs 426 crafting points (10,650 gp) to craft. 
Black Ooze Huge ooze, unaligned Armor Class 5 Hit Points 136 (13d12 + 52) Speed 20 ft., climb 20 ft.

Corrosive Form. A creature that touches the black ooze or hits it with a melee attack while within 5 feet of it takes 9 (2d8) acid damage. Any nonmagical weapon made of metal or wood that hits the black ooze corrodes. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent cumulative -1 penalty to damage rolls.

Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) bludgeoning damage plus 22 (5d8) acid damage. In addition, non magical armor worn by the target is partly dissolved and takes a permanent and cumulative -1 penalty to the AC it offers. The armor is destroyed if the penalty reduces its AC to 10. REACTIONS Split. When a black ooze that is Medium or larger is subjected to lightning or slashing damage, it splits into two new black oozes if it has at least 20 hit points. Each new black ooze has hit points equal to half the original black ooze's, rounded down. New black oozes are one size smaller than the original black ooze. 
Black oozes form in the foul slag pits of mining operations, given animation by mystic forces and freed to roam and consume. Black oozes possess a corrosive touch that metal; while their anatomy remains a mystery, they clearly seek to consume flesh as well. Some theorize that angry natural forces inhabited the original black oozes, animating the contaminated waste of mining operations and using it to enact vengeance on the miners. Others postulate that some miners, working far too deep in the ground, inadvertently operated in areas of powerful buried magic. Mystic energy penetrated the miners‘ slag pits and 
animated the sludgy runoff there. Whatever their origins, black oozes now exist as monsters in their own right, requiring no outside influence to live and reproduce (which they do by means of asexual splitting). Black oozes prefer to remain underground, though a few venture out onto surrounding mountainsides. They do not appear to have any sort of sentience, society, or ambition beyond engulfing whatever they encounter.

Bog beasts are large plant-like creatures, often found in temperate marshes of Azeroth. These massive plants may be mistaken for a thick clump of vegetation... if not for their vaguely humanoid shapes and surprising mobility. As the name suggests, bog-beasts are massive, shambling monsters that are half plant and half beast. Not much is known about these secretive lords of the swamp, except that they are territorial and rather aggressive. Explorers have recorded stories of their immense strength and resilience to harm. Bog-beasts are known to wander the Dustwallow Marsh, south of the Barrens. Bog-beasts use their strength to slam into their enemies, crushing opponents' defenses with their fists and whatever large objects they can throw at them.

This attack also corrodes away 4 inches thick of wood or metal. REACTIONS Death Throes. When the carrion grub dies, it explodes, and each creature within 15 feet of it must make a DC 15 Stamina saving throw, taking 6d6 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. 
Carrion grubs are disgusting worms that roam the Plaguelands searching for corpses to consume. They devour prey by gripping it in acid- coated mandibles, dissolving it, and sucking it up through their relatively tiny mouths. If they cannot find dead or dying creatures to feed upon, any living flesh will do. Carrion grubs prefer mammals, but will dine on reptiles or fish — they are voracious eaters that can consume close to half their body weight in a day. They cannot digest vegetable matter.  
Carrion grubs roam only, and have appeared the Plaguelands there only in recent years. It is unclear if they are the result of horrible experiments by overzealous necromancers, or simply a mutation created by the Scourge. Since they pursue undead flesh as readily as the living, it seems unlikely anyone created them on purpose. Carrion grubs move about haphazardly, constantly seeking food. If they detect suitable prey with their blindsense, they move to investigate, attacking rapaciously if the prey proves edible. If the food source moves out of blindsense range, the grub continues moving in the same direction until it catches up, comes to an obstacle, or detects another food source. Although grubs are stupid, their blindsense is quite acute and they will not, for example, pursue prey over the edge of a cliff. If confronted by a foe that cannot be attacked, such as flying archers, the grub escapes by burrowing. A carrion grub can wriggle its way only into soft earth, sand, or materials of a similar consistency. Most carrion grubs are 6 to 8 feet long and weigh 300 to 500 pounds, although much larger specimens exist.

Dryads are daughters of the demigod Cenarius. They monitor the health of Kalimdor‘s forests, ever watchful against the depredations of evil magic. Acting as teachers, healers, and playmates to the Kaldorei, dryads rally to fight those who encroach upon their forests, and serve the wilds with unwavering faith and a joyous smile. 
Grovekeeper The enchanted keepers of the grove are the favored sons of Cenarius. Like their dryad sisters, the keepers protect the woodlands from harm. Though they typically remain within the sacred Moonglade of Mount Hyjal, the keepers have been seen in other forests throughout Kalimdor. They are quick to heed the call to arms whenever there is a threat to the natural order. Affiliation. Independent or Alliance. The grove- keepers staunchly aid the night elves and preserve the forests, rivers, and wild lands of Kalimdor.

They are highly reclusive, sentient creatures, but do not possess the ability to speak. They strive foremost to protect the balance of nature. Chimaera hate seeing any natural races or creatures being harmed or oppressed. Those who victimize such creatures under the chimaera‘s protection will soon find a chimaera‘s wrath to be very formidable.

27 Constructed Mind. Mechanized creatures do not have a true mind, but are instead programmed to perform certain actions congruent with those of similar natural creatures. Thus, instead of Animal Handling checks, a creature handling or riding a mechanized animal makes checks with engineer‘s tools. Its new form is immune to all living creature-specific effects. It also consumes 1 charge (energy type determined by the creator) every hour of activity. It may remain latent, and activate on a trigger to save charges. Fuel (8 max).

Patrolling the streets of Gnomeregan, Crowd Pummelers bash anything they notice that violates the laws programmed into them. Since Gnomeregan‘s fall, most are programmed to attack anything that is not a leper gnome. Crowd Pummelers recognize and speak Common, but answer to only to the correct technological codes.  
34 Before Gnomeregan‘s fall, crowd pummelers warned violators and protestors aloud, giving them a short time to halt their offences, and kept their targets stable after a beating, but now all they shout is ―Intruder!‖ or ―Stop resisting!‖ before charging and pummeling the unfortunate victim to death. A crowd pummeler 9-60 costs 2,560 crafting points (engineering) as a huge construct of challenge 4 (or 64,000 gp). It has a malfunction rating of 1-5.

Otherwise, the effect lasts 24 hours or until the C‘thrax is destroyed, is on a different plane of existence than the target, or takes a bonus action to end the effect. REACTIONS Darkness Falls. The C‘thrax can use Binding Shadows as a reaction against any creature that successfully deals damage to it. 
C'Thraxxi (singular C'Thrax) are monstrous warbringers far larger and more resilient than other lesser n'raqi. They seem to usually serve as protectors within places of great importance to the Old Gods, and as commanders and generals of the Old Gods' forces. The C'Thrax Warlord Zon'ozz was one of the two faceless generals that led the assault on Wyrmrest Temple during the final battle against Deathwing. C'Thraxxi possess arthropod-like features, along with great strength and brutal intellect. They are capable of warping mind and body, turning creatures into corrupted versions of themselves by suffusing them with void magic, or by flesh- warping them into unthought-of creatures. Even after what mortals might consider death, C'Thraxxi can still slowly regain their energy and return to life through external help. The Twilight's Hammer made one such attempt to awaken Zakajz, and trolls have in the past succeeded to do so via blood rituals such as those that awakened Kith'ix and Mythrax. 
Devilsaur Huge beast, unaligned Armor Class 13 (Natural Armor) Hit Points 105 (10d12 + 40) Speed 50 ft.

Until this grapple ends, the target is restrained, and the devilsaur can't bite another target Tail. Melee Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 20 (3d8 + 7) bludgeoning damage. 
This giant lizard walks on two powerfully muscled hind legs. Two stunted, taloned forelimbs stretch out before it, and rows of bloodstained teeth fill its maw. The devilsaur takes its name from its vicious, relentless attacks, during which it utterly savages its victims to death. The devilsaur uses its bite to assault its prey, and its powerful hind legs and sheer size allow it to chase down almost any chosen prey.  
36 Despite the ferocity of this ill-tempered beast, hunters prize its tough but supple hide and often seek it out. Devilsaurs can grow to heights exceeding thirty feet and can weigh almost sixteen tons. Females tend to be smaller and lighter than males, but are even more aggressive. In a reversal of most creatures‘ natural gender roles, a female devilsaur abandons her eggs as soon as she lays them; male devilsaurs can identify a clutch of eggs they've fathered by scent, and will protect that clutch until the eggs hatch. The devilsaur uses its intimidating speed to charge prey as soon as they are within range. It typically targets the smallest creatures in a pack first, closing its powerful jaws over them and lifting them off the ground. The devilsaur mauls its prey, biting and shaking until it or the enemy stops moving, swallows, and then moves on to the next target. Badly wounded devilsaurs have been known to flee, sometimes carrying opponents with them.

Hit: 34 (4d12 + 8) piercing damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it is grappled (escape DC 20). Until this grapple ends, the

This terrifying specimen includes devilsaurs as King Mosh or King Krush, and other terrors.

If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.  
37 The diemetradon — one of the strongest predators in the Un‘Goro Crater — stalks its prey and rips it apart without mercy. This creature uses both its squat, strong legs tipped with sharp claws and its wickedly fanged mouth to great advantage, tearing apart its prey without a second thought. 
Pterrordax Large beast, unaligned Armor Class 16 (natural armor) Hit Points 59 (7d10 + 21) Speed 10 ft., fly 90 ft.

Their pigmentation ranges from moss green to deep emerald. While weaker than other dinosaurs, pterrordax possess great agility. Pterrordax prefer to hunt alone; normally, adventurers encounter them in pairs only during mating season, a two-week period in the springtime. Pterrordax may form flights when their breeding grounds are threatened by a strong foe, but disband once they eliminate the threat. 
Raptor Medium beast, unaligned Armor Class 13 (natural armor) Hit Points 26 (4d8 + 8) Speed 40 ft.

The ravasaurs of Un'Goro are large, raptor-like dinosaurs who're highly intelligent, volatile, and have a sense or code of conduct. Lar'korwi is the most dangerous. In Taur-ahe, its name means "Sharp Claw," but that does not do him justice. The ravasaurs of Zandalar are more distinct from raptors than the Un'Goro breed are, with crests of feathers on their heads and tails. Ravasaurs may be common throughout other lands than just Un'Goro, as they are common troll companions alongside raptors. The females produce an awful smell from a gland in their heads that allow males to know they are ready to breed.

They act identical except for the following.
