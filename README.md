# WoWDnDParser
Python Parser for the WoW DnD 5e Documents to an Machine friendly Format

This Project is WIP, The Spellparser kind of works, the monsterparser doesn't

The goal is to get all the Data into a Python dict, so it can be easily processed.
I once intented to put it into WorldAnvil, since it lets you (kindof) use a REST Endpoint for Submitions.
The monsters could be parsed to an Excel Sheet, that could be uploaded to KoboldFightClub.
